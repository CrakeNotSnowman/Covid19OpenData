# Covid-19 Data Sources

[Work In Progress]

Here is a curated list of data on the Covid-19 outbreak. This includes genetic sequences, geospatial data of where the outbreak is, protein models, and more. 

Associated with these will be python notebooks demonstrating how to bring the data into python to make it easier to perform data science while reducing the time spent searching for data to work with. 

The goal of this project is to reduce the barrier to entry to different facets of bioinformatics, and to compile a quick reference sheet for various data used in ongoing research. If using this data, please be mindful of the possible strain on computer systems, and avoid downloading information from a primary source in an automated fashion if a secondary source or mirror is available. 

## Literature


## Population Modeling

## Nucleotide Sequences
This data is explored in notebooks located in the `full_genomic_seqs` directory.

### NCBI Data Hub
[NCBI Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 data hub](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/virus/vssi/#/virus?SeqType_s=Nucleotide&VirusLineage_ss=Wuhan%20seafood%20market%20pneumonia%20virus,%20taxid:2697049)

This is a collection of data in GenBank and the Sequence Read Archive (SRA) tied to SARS-CoV-2. 

From here you can download the table data as a yaml, or
